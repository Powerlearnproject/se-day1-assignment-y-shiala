#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

It is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to develop and maintain high-quality software systems that involves the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software products.
It is important in the technology industry by enabling the creation the creation of software applications and systems that power communication, commerce, entertainment and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

~The establishment of software engineering as a dicipline - 
~The development of programming languages - These languages include, Fortran, C
~The advent of structured programming in the 1970s - It aimed to improve program organization and readability by utilizing sequence, selection (if/then/else), and iteration (loops) as the fundamental building blocks.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

a) Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
b) Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
c) Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
d) Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
e) Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
f) Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

a) Waterfall methodology involves a sequential approach with distinct phases that include, requirements, design and implementation, which flow downwards like a waterfall while agile methodology includes iterative and incremental approach which is focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change.

b) When it comes to flexibility, waterfall is rigid, and it's difficult to implement changes while agile is highly flexible, it adapts to changes quickly.

c) Waterfall is best for large projects which are well defined while agile is ideal for small to medium projects with evolving requirements.

d) In waterfall, its phases are distinct and follow a strict order while in agile phases overlap with frequent iterations.

e) Waterfall has minimal client involvement after the requirement phase while agile has continuous feedback and collaboration with the client.

f) In waterfall, testing is done after development is complete while agile testing is continuous throughout its development.

g) Documentation in waterfall is extensive at every stage while it is lightweight in agile and focuses on working software.

f) Waterfall delivers only one final product while agile delivers frequent final products in small increments.

Waterfall is ideal in well-defined and unlikely-to-change projects like: 
             - Government projects with strict regulations like building management systems.
             - Financial software like banking systems which have clear, structured 
               workflows and security compliance.
Agile is suitable for projects with evolving requirements and a need for fast feedback like:
             - Software startups like new mobile apps.
             - Game development.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

 a) A Software Developer has a role in writing code and implementing software solutions. They are respinsible for :
        •	Write, test, and debug code based on project requirements.
        •	Develop software applications following best coding practices.
        •	Collaborate with designers, analysts, and other developers.
        •	Optimize and improve application performance.
        •	Maintain and update software as needed.

 b) A Quality Assurance Engineer has a role in ensuring software quality by designing and executing test plans. They are responsible for:
        •	Develop and execute test plans, cases, and scripts.
        •	Perform manual and automated testing to find bugs.
        •	Work with developers to fix identified issues.
        •	Ensure compliance with industry standards and best practices.
        •	Document and report test results and issues.

 c) A project manager has a role of overseeing the planning, execution and delivery of software projects. They are responsible for:
        •	Define project scope, goals, and deliverables.
        •	Plan and allocate resources effectively.
        •	Monitor project progress and manage risks.
        •	Facilitate communication between stakeholders and teams.
        •	Ensure project documentation and reports are maintained.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

a) Integrated Development Environments provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code. For example, Visual studio, Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA.
b) Version Control Systems help in tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members. For example, Git and subversion

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

a) Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays. This could be overcome by applying the agile methodology and employing effective communication with the client.
b) Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality. This canbe overcome by prioritizing on tasks and having regular assessments of project goals and timelines.
c) Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs. It is overcomed by following coding best practices, maintaining clean modular code, allocating time for refactoring and optimizing existind code.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

a) Unit Testing: It involves testing individual components or modules of software. It identifies bugs early in development, making debugging easier by isolating issues and it encourages modular and maintainable code.
b) Integration Testing:  It involves testing interactions between different components or subsystems. It helps in detecting issues in data flow and module dependencies, prevents integration failures in large systems, and ensures smooth communication between services eg APIs, and databases.
c) System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole. It verifies the overall functionality of the software, ensures compliance with user and business requirements and it identifies performance, security, and usability issues.
d) Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs. It ensures the software aligns with user expectations and business goals, it identifies usability issues before public release and it reduces risks of failure after deployment.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
- It is the practice of crafting questions or statements to generate accurate, relevant and high-quality responses from AI models.
- Interacting with AI models improves response quality, enhances efficiency of the responses, controls AI  behaviour and tone of the AI responses.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt- "Give me some ideas"
Improves Prompt - "Give me 10 ideas for improving my teaching skills on children"
Why is it more effective? 
    - It is more specific, it narrows down
    - It is clearer
    -It has specified the targeted audience.
